			<span class="redbox">Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the waterfowl family Anatidae, which also includes swans and geese.<br> The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae; they do not represent a monophyletic group<br> (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks.<br> Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.</span>
